// This is just a text file, but I'll be using java notation for comments
// NOTE: I use the symbol _<_ to mean "the return character"
// Also, if I type "" that means the empty string

/* There will be about 9+N (N is number of tests, see below) lines in each test-case file:
	line 1 will state in plain English the project requirement being tested (basically just bs this I think), followed by _<_
	line 2 will have the name of the class being tested, followed by _<_
	line 3 will have the name of the specific method being tested, again followed by _<_
	line 4 will have the test case ID number (01-25), followed by _<_
	line 5 has only _<_
	line 6 will have the name of the driver used to test this method, followed by _<_
	line 7 will have the number [I call this number "N" through the rest of this template] of test cases that will be run on this method (typed as a numeral), followed by _<_
	lines 8 through 8+N will have the parameters for a single test of the method and the expected output(s) (NOTE: if multiple parameters are required, each is separated by a comma and no spaces); after parameter(s), put a semicolon (again no spaces) and then the expected output(s); each line ends with _<_
	line N+1 will say "end" WITHOUT a _<_
