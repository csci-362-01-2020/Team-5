-Deliverable #5: inject 5 faults
  *make report
  *make pdf
  *document progress on wiki
  *
  *due 11.24 (one week from Tues)


-Fancy up html?
  *I haven't done any of the html part personally, so idk how hard this would be
  *Some possible changes: background color?, multiple linkable pages?, make test requirements more readable
  *
  *I feel like since this is what shows up immediately when we run the script, the nicer this looks the better opinion Bowring will have on the rest of our project (bc first impressions)


--Final report/presentation!!
  *redo all deliverables for final report, make it look really nice and cohesive
  *put a ton of stuff on wiki, as if we'd been doing it at each stage
  *make and practice giving presentation (all have to speak)
  *!!says presentation should be 20 min!!!
    .. with 5 min after for questions (think of questions for other groups for brownie points with Bowring)
  *make poster for SSM fair
  *
  *we have thanksgiving to work on this but then it's ALL due that next week



-Individually, make sure your blogs have everything and email a pdf of them to Bowring
